# Edit Code ‘Z’

DEPI:
>Edit code Z is only used to remove secondary addresses. It will not remove a primary distance based address.

Council property systems are generally not reliable sources of secondary address information, so Pozi Connect does not attempt to retire secondary addresses. The Z edit code is not used.
