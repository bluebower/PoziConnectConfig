## GIS on a Stick

#### Notes:

#### Things to change:

* Vicmap Railways are showing disused railway. (only show railway from PTV?)
* add labels to waterways and water bodies
* add name labels to open space / forests
* remove planning growth boundary (duplicate data with growth area)
* add parcel table
* add CMA boundary
* vicmap hydro isn't being used? add it to replace water from vicmap lite?
* Drop some vicmap lite tables? data duplicated by transport / hydro / admin
* Trunkate all tables on import for unneeded fields
* PTV missing layers. only show routes and stops for tram and bus.
* PTV for train only track and stations.
* Public land is shown from vicmaplite not CL_tenure
