# Campaspe

## Parcel Query

Inidividual parcel attributes are based on Maribyrnong query. However, the spi value is populated directly from the spi field in Fujitsu, rather than being constructed from individual attributes.

The Fujitsu spi value appears to be better maintained (and therefor better matched to Vicmap) than the individual attributes.

## Property Address Query

based on CommonGround_Address_Campaspe.SQL, with formatting changes based on Maribyrnong config
