##### Street names that needed a workaround
Ordinance Reserve missing street suffix

Austin Crescent West and East have no street suffix

Magnolia path no suffix

O'Farrell Street

The crescent

The grand

The boulevard

The esplanade

##### Units with a G prefix for Ground Floor

units with a g prefix are stored in the unit suffix column along with the number, split out the field to get the numbers and the G into the correct fields. although i think they mean to use G as in floor. 

it looks like they use G for the units are on the ground floor but don't describe other units and they don't always use the G in the unit Suffix field sometimes its in the floor prefix field. with only one recorded with 'G01\' in the floor field. there is no other floor data stored in there database. and apart from the 'G' no other unit prefix data. so i would assume the G isn't a unit prefix

looking at existing data in vicmap the G is used sometimes in the unit prefix field and sometimes in the floor type field also with 2 instance of it in the floor suffix field.
