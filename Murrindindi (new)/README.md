### Primary Address

Simone Elliott from Murrindindi says:

> from what I can ascertain the table is auprparc and if the field str_seq has a zero (0) it is the primary address to use.  In saying that I can see examples where there is multiple primary addresses on the one assessment.

In response, Brian Hall from Civica says:

> The str_seq ‘0’ would only be used to override an address for an assessment. By default the lowest registered parcel number is used on an assessment but if the site wants to use a different parcel’s address they use the ‘Make Primary Parcel’ button to set the sequence zero on that higher numbered parcel.
 
> So in the majority of cases where the site is happy with the primary parcel being the one with the lowest parcel number (generally first one created) the sequence numbers are all null and so you need to take that into account.
