# Mornington Peninsula

## Vicmap Import Procedure

Mornington Peninsula maintains property information for its own LGA (352) and also French Island (379).

Mornington Peninsula's 'Import Vicmap' procedure has been customised to use custom task items that can handle multiple LGA values, rather than using the shared 'Import Vicmap' task file.

## Property Address Query

Copied from Mitchell's Pozi Connect address query, with code used from Mornington Peninsula PIQA query, and adapted to suit.

Major changes required for accommodating boatsheds.

(This address query is not a suitable example on which to base another council's address query.)

## Parcel Query

Copied from Mitchell's Pozi Connect parcel query, adapted to suit.

Internal SPI sourced from `nucland.text6`.

Added crefno.
